# Booking services with providers API

## Objective

This project is created as a challenge for a job offer.

## Features

- This service lets clients book appointments with providers
- The service requires you signup with a username and password for security
- After singning-in, you get a JWT token, which you must include in every request, if not, the service considers the request invalid.
- The JWT token is valid for an hour
- Every user has a role: Admin, Client or Provider. By default, the Client role is provided if none specified (view the endpoints details further below)
- All requests are responded with JSON objects.


## Enhancements To-Do list

- UI for admin staff
- Variety of reports
- Recover password
- Booking appointments for a range of days (as of now, users can only book appointments for one day)

## Live link

The backend is hosted on Heroku.
